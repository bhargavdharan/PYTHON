## Beginner Level

### Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. In this topic, you will learn the basics of Python syntax, how to run Python programs, and get familiar with the interactive Python shell.

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in Python. This topic covers how to declare and assign values to variables, naming conventions, and rules for variable names. You will also explore different data types in Python, such as numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### Control Structures

Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. This topic covers if statements, elif and else statements for conditional branching, and loops such as for loops and while loops for iteration. You will learn how to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. This topic covers how to define and call functions in Python, pass arguments, and return values. You will also learn about function parameters, default values, and the concept of scope.

### Modules and Packages

Modules and packages in Python help organize and reuse code. This topic introduces how to import and use modules in your programs. You will learn about built-in modules and how to create your own modules. Additionally, you will explore the concept of packages, which are directories containing multiple modules.

### File Handling (Reading and Writing Files)

File handling is essential for reading data from files and writing data to files. This topic covers how to open, read, write, and close files in Python. You will learn different modes for file access and how to handle common file-related operations.

### Exception Handling

Exception handling allows you to handle and recover from errors or exceptions that occur during program execution. This topic covers how to use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. You will learn about different types of exceptions, handling multiple exceptions, and using finally blocks for cleanup operations.

### Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and their interactions. This topic introduces the fundamental concepts of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, and inheritance. You will learn how to create classes, instantiate objects, and use inheritance to create derived classes.
